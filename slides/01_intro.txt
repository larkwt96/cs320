the Gayle-Shaply algorithm
Creates stable matching
O(n^2)

Init no one matched
while some man is free
    choose a free man
    w = highest women on his list whom he hasn't proposed
    if w free
        match
    else if w perfers m to her current match, m'
        m,w get matched, m' is freed
    else m remains free

Need to prove correctness: Prove no unstable pairs

Scheduling
Given start times and end times, max number of tasks completed
Solution: Greedy algorithm, choose next ending time of available tasks.
